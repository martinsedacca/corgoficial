  # Fix RLS Policies for Authentication Error

  This migration fixes the Row Level Security policies that are causing 401 errors
  when authenticated users try to perform operations on tables.

  ## Changes Made
  1. Drop existing conflicting policies
  2. Create simplified policies that work with the current authentication system
  3. Ensure authenticated users can perform necessary operations
